    "This experiment will test the claim that *“Warm-starting neural network training can lead to lower test accuracy than random initialized models, even if they have similar final training accuracy”*. We anticipate that there will be a generalization gap between the two models trained with the two initialization methods.\n",

    "We compare two ways of training a ResNet-18 model, which is a type of deep neural network that can classify images. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images of 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, and dogs. The experiment splits the dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to update the model weights, and the test set is used to evaluate the model performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The warm-starting model starts with some pre-trained weights that are learned by training the model on 50% of the training data.\n",
    "-   The randomly initialized model starts with random weights that are not learned from any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models train on the full training data for 350 epochs, where one epoch means one pass over the entire data. The experiment will measure the accuracy of the models on both the training and test sets, which is the percentage of correctly classified images."
